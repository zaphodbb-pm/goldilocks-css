            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Goldilocks-CSS</strong> is built to support a split complementary colour scheme for the main web
                page decoration.  By using HSL values, the hue can be rotated around 360° to select a primary colour by
                using the variable <code>--main-color</code>.  The default is 140°.  Saturation and lightness can then be chosen
                to finalize that primary colour.  A variable <code>—main-color-offset</code> controls the complementary colours.
                The default is 30 degrees.  Setting this to 120° produces a triadic colour scheme.
                All three of these decoration colours have light and dark variants to support backgrounds and hover states.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>Note that notification colours (success, warning, danger) have fixed HSL variables as they are more standard
            and have specific meaning.  Also the link colour and shades of grey are also provided and have fixed HSL fixed
            variables.  You can, of course, adjust these variables to suit your needs.
        </p>

        <p>There is a dark mode over-ride file that adjusts these colours to meet the needs of contrast in this mode.
            Typically the decoration and notification colours are lightened to provide better contrast on a dark background.

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Web colour accessibility  is a complex area.  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/" target=_blank>WCAG 2.1</a>
                provides a detailed discussion on the need to meet web accessibility and provides commentary on
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#use-of-color" target=_blank>proper use of colour</a>.
                WebAim (the Institute for Disability Research, Policy, and Practice) has a detailed discussion on designing
                in <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/" target=_blank>accessible contrast</a>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>In general, these are <a href="https://dev.to/alvaromontoro/building-your-own-color-contrast-checker-4j7o" target=_blank>complex calculations</a>
            that you can usually find an <a href="https://cliambrown.com/contrast/" target=_blank>on-line tool</a> or
            <a href="https://contrast-ratio.com/#rgb%28255%2C%20255%2C%20255%29-on-hsl%28340%2C70%25%2C40%25%29" target=_blank>contrast ratio calculator</a>
            to help with colour contrast selection.  The WCAG recommendation is to ensure that the contrast between two colours is at
            least 4.5:1.
        </p>

        <p>Where the challenges occur is around selecting a background element colour that has text.  For example, a yellow
            background with white text has a low contrast ratio unless the yellow background is very dark.  This is usually not
            desired or interesting.  This also applies to colours adjacent to yellow such as green and orange.  Consequently,
            black text on these backgrounds has high contrast rather than white text that usually fails the contrast test.
            This is often where designers stumble.
        </p>

        <p>The reverse is true for blue or red.  White text on red or blue backgrounds has high contrast.  Black text on
            these backgrounds often fails accessibility unless these backgrounds are very light.
        </p>

            <h2>So What Does this Mean for Us?</h2>

            <p>With <strong>Goldilocks-CSS</strong> we try to help the designer to select a colour scheme and then to derive
                supporting colours to ensure that good contrast is maintained.  That means that a designer can select a primary
                hue and a split complementary angle that will produce three colours.  The designer can also choose the saturation
                level and lightness for these colours.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>The aforementioned calculator tools are highly recommended to try and test various hue, saturation and lightness settings to
            ensure that the website has the colours it needs as well as meeting accessibility requirements.

            <h2>Key Variables</h2>

            <p>The file <b>initial-theme-colors.css</b> has all of the colour definitions.  The following variables define the
                theme’s three colours:
            </p>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><code>--main-color</code> is the primary colour hue value (default 140°)</li>
            <li><code>--main-color-offset</code> is the complementary colours +,- degree offset from main + 180°
                (default 30°.  Note that a setting of 0° sets secondary = tertiary and yields a two colour theme.
                A setting of 120° produces a triadic colour theme.</li>
            <li><code>--main-color-complement-low</code> sets the secondary complementary colour</li>
            <li><code>--main-color-complement-high</code> sets the tertiary complementary colour</li>
            <li><code>--main-color-sl-light</code> sets the colour lightening for saturation and lightness </li>
            <li><code>--main-color-sl-dark</code> sets the colour darkening for saturation and lightness </li>
            <li><code>--primary</code> is the resulting main theme colour</li>
            <li><code>--secondary</code> is the resulting secondary theme colour</li>
            <li><code>--tertiary</code> is the resulting tertiary theme colour</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Note</b> that you do not need to use this split complementary theme method.  You can directly set
            <code>--primary</code>, <code>--secondary</code> and / or <code>—tertiary</code> colours with any custom values
            that you wish to use.  Also, any variable can be overridden by a subsequent custom css file or by Javascript code
            running on the browser.
