        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Since 2011, there have been many CSS frameworks introduced into the market.  The most notable being Bootstrap, Bulma and lately Tailwind.
            Designed primarily for the front-end developer, they have provided a simpler and more consistent solution to creatively styling HTML layouts.
            They all solve the problem of letting development move along quickly, but they also trade-off the best customer experience through large
            file sizes and the need for javascript for some component functionality.  Utility type CSS frameworks also burden (increase) the HTML files and
            don't make of caching to reduce Time to First Paint (TTFP) and increase page load times.
        </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, they also come with technical debt.  Most notably, many of these frameworks stray away from HTML5 standards compliance
            and are, too often, semantically incorrect.  These frameworks also do not use the latest changes in CSS3.  The use of classes is verbose and
            the class name terminology can also be non-intuitive sometimes.  Many have not been updated to the latest CSS3 capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>Furthermore, the marketing of these frameworks is very noisy and make the developer believe that they are the only viable solution.
            They also tend to overpromise and underdeliver, often leading to frustration and wasted time for developers.  A delayed project also gets
            scrutiny from the folks paying the bills.
        </p>

        <p>
            But what is the realty?  The table below shows the usage statistics and market shares of CSS frameworks as of February 2026.  It is
            interesting to note that Bootstrap is still the most popular framework. Despite the fact that Tailwind has gained a lot of traction,
            it only represents a small fraction of the market at 0.3% overall and at 1.6% of the CSS market share.  Most interesting is that 4 out of 5
            websites do not use any CSS framework, implying that they have been built with custom or in-house CSS.

        <p>Web development techniques have matured in the last decade.  <a href="http://w3c.org" target=_blank>W3C</a> has
            updated both HTML and CSS standards to accommodate the changing needs of the business of website / application building.
            These latest versions of the web standards have become powerful enough to reduce the reliance on Javascript
            to control the user experience.  This maturation of web standards has delivered very comprehensive capabilities.
            Modern evergreen browsers have become very sophisticated and efficient in handling HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for
            presentation to the point that Javascript use can be minimized or, in some cases such as static web pages, can be eliminated.
            Javascript can return to its roots to provide a way for the web page to communicate with the server to fetch user data and to
            hydrate HTML scaffolding.
        </p>

        <p>The widespread adoption and use of web technologies has increased the supply of companies capable of delivering websites to
            meet the needs of the buyers.  This competition has also increased the competitive pressures on web page / application builders.
            The plethora of frameworks and languages available makes architectural choices critical and has a major impact on project
            costs and delivery times. Note that all frameworks / libraries work as advertised and do their job to help build web pages,
            but do so at varying cost points. These changes have shifted the focus from developer-driven innovation to the
            product manager who has to live in a world of constraints of both time and money.
        </p>

        <p>The product manager has a mandate for managing a project’s profit and loss.  The loss part is easy: hire developers and
            just keep building stuff. The profit side is hard … really hard.  In order to have profit, a project needs to have
            customers that spend money (ie generate revenue). This revenue is the money available to a project manager to build
            more stuff and, more importantly, debug and maintain stuff that has already been built.  Limited revenue also
            limits the developer team size.  All of these constraints force the product manager into trade-offs: user experience
            is important, only some features can be built, code must be debugged and maintained, customer support has to be paid for, etc.
        </p>

        <p>Although every developer looks for unopinionated tools to use, the reality is that as soon as a product plan is struck,
            technology decisions are made that create a very opinionated tool kit that the team is required to use.
            There are many benefits to doing so for development.  These benefits also flow directly to the business side as well.
            Unfortunately, technology stacks are often constructed from many libraries that can add a tremendous amount of complexity
            that then becomes difficult to manage.  This then requires much more labour to make work properly and can delay the
            product's entry into the market.

        <h2>Another Way Forward</h2>

        <p>
            We have accumulated a lot of experiences from UX designers on
            <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/topic/psychology-and-ux/?asset=articles#articles" target=_blank>what works on a website</a>
            and what to avoid.
            These experiences have been distilled into a set of best practices that can be applied to any web project.
            So, rather than focussing on new shiny bling, we can focus on the (mundane) best practices that have been proven to work.

        <p><strong>Goldilocks-CSS</strong> is inspired from the work of many people devoted to improving all aspects of web
            design and technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Goldilocks-CSS</strong> is a project designed to improve the user experience and to meet the needs of the business
            rather than the developer alone.
            <strong>Goldilocks-CSS</strong> is driven by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle" target=_blank>Goldilocks Principle </a>
            and strives to <b>find the sweet spot</b> between a good user experience and efficient project execution.
            <strong>Goldilocks-CSS</strong> is more of a modular set of best practices rather than a just a framework.
            <strong>Goldilocks-CSS</strong> helps the product manager deliver products in a timely way by:
        </p>

        <ul class="is-indented-1">
            <li>Being a comprehensive source of truth for consistent web page creation;</li>
            <li>Using semantic HTML5 for content structure to meet accessibility requirements (and hence reduce litigation);</li>
            <li>Adhering to HTML and CSS standards to future-proof your project;</li>
            <li>Leveraging modern CSS3 to create a “no Javascript” presentation layer;</li>
            <li>Reducing javascript code complexity;</li>
            <li>Increasing HTML code readability for maintenance work by minimizing presentation layer cruft.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The objective is faster time to market at a much lower cost.
